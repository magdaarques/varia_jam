 Helpful issues to learn coding together in Varia

## What language  are we going to visual code?

Visual code with [Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/docs/) is a live code-able video synth and coding environment that runs directly in the browser.

Olivia Jack is the creator. You can listen [podcast.Artist and hackers. Ep 10. Art tools: Live coding with Hydra](https://www.artistsandhackers.org/hydra) talking about the project.

We said that hydra is our queer-livevisual-coding.

## What Hydra can do?

* to mix and add effects to camera feeds, screenshares, live streams, and videos
* to create generative and audio-reactive visuals, and share them online with others
* in combination with other [javascript libraries](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/docs/docs/learning/extending-hydra/extending-hydra/) such as P5.js, Tone.js, THREE.js, or gibber
* to add interactive video effects to a website
* to experiment with and learn about video feedback, fractals, and pixel operations
* to stream video between browsers and live-jam with others online

## How we are going to share our live-jam

We are going to use the tool made by [@mushkr](https://github.com/munshkr/flok)

We can code, edit and share [together](https://flok.cc/s/wispy-violet-tiger-c5715ef3#targets=hydra&c0=b3NjKCgoKT0%252BYS5mZnRbMF0qNDAwKSwyLC4xKS5vdXQoKQ%253D%253D)
